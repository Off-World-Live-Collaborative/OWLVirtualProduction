#   Off World Live Open-Source Virtual Production Repository 

  
*This repository is an Unreal Engine project that aims to help all skill levels to get started and advance in the world of Virtual Production and Virtual Broadcast.*
   
## üêµ Why do I need this repo?

Virtual Production and real time Virtual Filmmaking can be a complicated beast, with many challenges and rabbit holes of research to explore and get lost in. Here at Off World we have been amongst it for a considerable amount of time now, and we feel that among our Discord and our greater networks we have been able to distill down some incredible workflows for indie and large studio filmmakers alike. 

We have decided to collate this wealth of knowledge and innovation in the most useful way possible; an example project that can be downloaded and booted up so that whether your background is in filmmaking, game development, motion graphics, (or none of the above!) you will be able to get going in the world of virtual production immediately.  

This repo is based on the idea that you should never have to start from scratch when working on a creative project. With a project that already includes useful assets and configs your set up time is reduced to zero and you can get going with the creative side. 


        
## üåà How can it be this easy? 
We have carefully crafted the project to be as resistance free as possible, so even with very little experience you can jump straight in and just start shooting Mixed reality footage. 

We are constantly iterating on this project with additions to the repo based off of user feedback, and by being open to user additions.

All workflows will be backed up with tutorials and documentation if you want to dive into how these things work, and build off of the techniques. 

## üëã  How can I use this project?

This project is open source, with a permissive Apache license. This means that you are free to use and adapt anything in this project for your own purposes. You can then use it for any project, paid or otherwise. 

## üåû How can I give back?

We are excited to share our knowledge with you, but even more exciting is the idea that this can grow as a communal hub of information and techniques. So we urge you to give back to this repo in the form of any kind of asset, config or level that you think could be useful to the community. Even simple things like post-process materials that you re-use often can go a long way for someone with less understanding than you, so sharing is heavily encouraged!



## üåç This UE project includes: üåç

## Static Meshes/ level building resources:   
- Basic modular level building assets designed to make environment building quick, easy and experimental. Many assets include multiple material slots for optional addition of light strips or variation at user‚Äôs discretion. 
- A variety of static meshes to give your studios and environments some unique flavor. 
- Example studios ready to be personalized to your requirements. 
- Example Configs that are fully functional from a media I/O perspective and ready for environments to be built around them. (in progress)

## Blueprints:

An ever growing resource of useful blueprints for both level building and deployment of virtual production/broadcast systems. 

- Environment building Blueprints.
- Interactables such as sliding doors.
- Light rigs such as a standard studio light rig that follows a target point. 
- Camera control Blueprints 
- Composure Config switching Blueprints 

## Materials

- Level building materials for studio setups and environment design.
- Customizable decal actors for addition of your own logos to your studio setups. 
- Animated materials designed to be useful for both environment design and artistic flare. 

## Composure Folder:

*This folder contains all the assets needed to quickly create a composure composition*

- Useful transform pass set ups such as ‚Äò 2 layer comp‚Äô ‚Äò3 layer comp with matte‚Äô and ‚Äòdual screen comp‚Äô for those that use composure these can be quickly selected for very quick comp creation. All input names correlate to names of the composure elements so that you can more quickly switch transform passes.
- Additional Blueprints that can be added on to composure systems such as a plane aimer BP which ensures the plane always faces the camera both in editor and at runtime. 
- Basic Post Process effects re-worked to be compatible with composure transform passes, these range from utilities such as blur, crop, hue/saturation materials, to more advanced effects like rain drop displacement, or parametric VHS Filters. 

 ## How do I get involved? 

- For a simple download you can just download the Zip of the latest Github release and open the project locally. 
- As a contributor you are invited to clone the repo and issue pull requests to the master branch, these will be carefully reviewed and quality assured before merge. 
- You can also join our weekly 
[Virtual Production Q+A sessions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1yv2vhnfc8&list=PLElT6SIg9JnBuvHHnVX6ZzRI2AVQKf7nV&ab_channel=OFFWORLDLIVE)
         as we explore new features of the repo and open up discussion to the community.
