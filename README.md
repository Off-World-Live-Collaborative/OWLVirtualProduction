#   PhysAttach

edit: test test

This read me is about the PhysAttach branch. See the main branch for more details about OWLVirtualProduction.

IMPORTANT: PhysAttach is based on the Physics Control UE Plugin. Enable the plugin and restart UE.

This system is designed to easily attach actors to other actors and have them follow their parent using physics. The intent is to make the system compatible with any actors.

For more information about Physics Control watch this demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FK7FBBdY5fY
